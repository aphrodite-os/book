# Aphrodite

Aphrodite is a kernel and OS, designed to be secure and modern. All official projects(projects created and maintained by the Aphrodite team) that are directly part of the OS are written in Rust, and Rust support is a priority over other languages(however, ideally we will support other languages). The Aphrodite kernel is in the [aphrodite-os/kernel](https://github.com/aphrodite-os/kernel) repo, and work-in-progress documentation is in [aphrodite-os/book](https://github.com/aphrodite-os/book).

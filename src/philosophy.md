# Philosophy

- Keep Aphrodite and all official components(projects created and maintained by the Aphrodite team) [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) (tl;dr for the link: Free software is software where the users have control to do pretty much whatever they want with it; think of the "free" in "free software" as in "free speech," not as in "free snacks.")
- Prevent something like [what happened to GNU](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html) from happening to whatever the main software distribution ends up being.
- Try to prevent memory safety bugs and other bugs that leak data from ever happening (using Rust helps with this).
- Prevent relying on archaic behaviour, however support somewhat old computers.
- NEVER charge money for any official component of Aphrodite.
